<body>
  <div>
    <a href="./projection/canvas_api/">2d canvas api</a> - First foray into 3d rendering. Projects a scene to a (virtual)
    image plane and uses the 2d canvas api to draw it with lines and fills. Runs pretty smoothly but it's very limited.
  </div>

  <div>
    <a href="./projection/rasterizer/">full rasterization algorithm</a> - Lib-free & minimal canvas api implementation
    of a rasterizer running on the js main thread. Looks decent, but barely manages a usable framerate.
  </div>

    <div>
      <a href="./webgl/">WebGL</a> - Using what I've learned so far with an actual graphics api that runs on the gpu.
    </div>

  <div>
    <a href="./raytracer/">Raytracer</a> - Mostly an exercise in copying/transposing an example from c++ to js. Not interactive,
    and takes a few seconds to render. Will get more into raytracing later.
  </div>
